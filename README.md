# 201 Datasets - Stocks and Interest Rates

[Kaggle](kaggle.com) is a dataset website that has apparently made its sole mission to absolutely not be compatible with just linking a csv dataset by url to an R document. 
See: <code>data <- read.csv(actualgoodwebsite.com/data.csv)</code>

In light of this obvious oversight, I have had to upload the following [S&P 500 stocks](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks/data) dataset and
this [Federal Interest Rate](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/federalreserve/interest-rates) dataset through github in order to access it for our final project. Shoutout to Dr. Rigoli!
